Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in a list of positive integers, as well as a positive integer "magicnum", as inputs. Your goal will be to remove all integers from the list whose values will match their index in the final output, 
with the exception of any integers at index = magicnum. Add integers to your return list sequentially, from the start of your input list.

Within the function:
Return a list of integers composed of integers from your input list starting from the front of the input list, such that in the returned list no value is equal to its index, unless index = magicnum.
Hint 1: It can cause problems if you're iterating over a list and modifying it at the same time (consider what you might try to access...). Instead, you can create a new list an keep track of integers you want to add.
Hint 2: If you use indexing, you have to think carefully of your index. Not only will you have an index for iterating over your input list, but you will also need to consider your current index with respect to your new list.
(I.e. where are you trying to add things?)

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
Create an input list and fill it with some integers (you don't have to use user input).
Get user input for the magicnum.
Print your function call using the input list and magicnum.

#ANSWER

if __name__ == "__main__":
    og_list = [0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5]

def smart():
    magician = int(input("Pick a magic number: "))
    
    new_list = []
    counter = 0 # instead of making a new list to count what index you're talking about

    for n in og_list: # so n is actually the element in the list
        # if the index position is the element but the magician is also the element, add the element to new_list and increment the counter
        if n == magician:
            new_list.append(n)
            counter += 1

        # if the index position is not the element, add the element to new_list and increment the counter
        elif n != counter:
            new_list.append(n)
            counter += 1
            
        # if the index position (aka counter) is the element, pass
        elif n == counter:
            pass

        # print the new list
        print(new_list)

    print("Final:", new_list)
